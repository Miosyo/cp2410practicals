The rain poured and poured, creating a rhythmic patter-patter on the roof.
Drip, drip, drip—it seemed like an endless symphony of water droplets.
The sound echoed through the empty halls, halls that once echoed with laughter and joy.
But now, silence. Silence that hung heavy, heavy like a weight on the heart.
Memories flooded, flooded like a tidal wave, crashing against the walls of the mind.
It was a torrential downpour of emotions, emotions that begged to be felt, felt deep within the soul.
And so, I stood there, there in the midst of the storm, letting it wash over me, over me like a cleansing baptism.
